      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a &lt;em&gt;student&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;prospective economist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;retiring&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;debater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I care about the science and practice of development: evaluating policy and spotlighting evidence in policy-making&amp;mdash;policy in pursuit of outcomes, not just noble intent. I care about public finance: I believe that state capacity misspent is state capacity lost and that efficient, well-informed states can play a vital role in transforming lives. I think that a prerequisite to this is building reliable, high frequency administrative data. I am fascinated by human behavior: I think that insights from psychology help us far better understand economic problems. I care about poverty alleviation and upward mobility and some things that drive them: education, migration, banking, capital, and opportunity. I care about representation in policy-makers and in enumerating policy outcomes. My work follows my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
