      <description>Hello! I am Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy, a first-year undergraduate student at Harvard University. I aspire to a career in research and academia. I plan to pursue a Concentration in Applied Mathematics and Economics with a Secondary in Computer Science. I am deeply interested in economics, data science, public policy, computer science, and feminist theory. I am also a parliamentary debater (I debated for Team India in school, and now do so for the Harvard College Debating Union).</description>
