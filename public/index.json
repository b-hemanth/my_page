However, as dissent and opposition move online on to social media, how do strongmen leaders still control and set narratives? I explore the use of Twitter Bots in India by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and make multiple novel contributions to the study of bot use by the BJP. First, I offer rigorous evidence of bots reacting to key events with disaggregation of events and study of time lags showing that bot creation is highest when there is a dominating political event occurring and progressively falls with time or with lower national relevance of the event. Here I find a regression coefficient of 80.742***, between the bot creation in a day and key political events—evidence that more than twice the median number of bots created in a day are created on days with key events. This establishes the deliberate attempt to dominate political discourse around political issues perceived as important in public eye—more critical events result in more bot creation and as topics grow irrelevant with time, bot creation wears off to usual norms. Second, I present evidence around their strategy, clustering, and amplification: dual prongs of mass retweeting and mentioning “seed” bots and prominent pro-BJP sources. I describe seed bots, describe the bot network, its interlinkedness, and the existence of large clusters very quickly in the beginning of the tree diagram. Finally, I offer evidence of propagandic sentiments in use by Tweets and account descriptions and present quasi evidence of coordination between bot content. I also make contributions of public interest in understanding the prevalence of political bots in India and ways to identify them.\nRead full text as PDF.\n","date":1589673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589673600,"objectID":"9f74cda1662b1023f872398180af0e99","permalink":"https://b-hemanth.com/publication/lessons-on-teacher-pay/","publishdate":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lessons-on-teacher-pay/","section":"publication","summary":"Evidence from the use of Twitter Bots by Modi’s BJP in India","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Twitter Botocracy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"Work in progress View as .pdf in Dropbox.\n","date":1589673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589673600,"objectID":"e0bf9b5d4674c20649081ae6a8f49234","permalink":"https://b-hemanth.com/post/twitter-botocracy-evidence-from-the-use-of-twitter-bots-by-modi-s-bjp-in-india/","publishdate":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/twitter-botocracy-evidence-from-the-use-of-twitter-bots-by-modi-s-bjp-in-india/","section":"post","summary":"Work in progress View as .pdf in Dropbox.","tags":["India","Democracy","Indian Elections","Lok Sabha Elections","Modi","regression","Twitter"],"title":"Twitter Botocracy: Evidence from India (WIP)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy"],"categories":null,"content":"Policy Brief on Performance-Based Pay for Teachers Read full text as PDF.\n","date":1587081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587081600,"objectID":"b01ea71c0f1f89ca83b665b70dd41195","permalink":"https://b-hemanth.com/publication/botocracy/","publishdate":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/botocracy/","section":"publication","summary":"Policy brief on performance-based pay for public school teachers.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Lessons on Teacher Pay","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572134400,"objectID":"5cad629db8e4d6cfab67403da0798bb7","permalink":"https://b-hemanth.com/project/twitter-indian-elections-2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/twitter-indian-elections-2019/","section":"project","summary":"Dashboard analysing sentiments, mapping views, and studying potential bot activity in the BJP 2019 Electoral Campaign.","tags":["Dashboard"],"title":"Twitter in the Biggest Election","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569542400,"objectID":"a373be187b4960e259fe99376fd12f3c","permalink":"https://b-hemanth.com/project/gunshots-dc-webapp/","publishdate":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/gunshots-dc-webapp/","section":"project","summary":"Dashboard built with [Ilkin Bayramli](https://github.com/ibayramli2001) interactively animating maps of gunshots in DC across time.","tags":["Dashboard"],"title":"Gunshots in Washington DC","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"I built a web app with Ilkin Bayramli studying gunshots in Washington D.C.

Cloud-based version control system But what is version control?\n - Simple analogy: Google Drive for developers - Track and manage changes to your code - Version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging - Work with online Git repository - Make changes in your own branch - Merge with online cloud branch - Changes are tracked and can be reverted if needed   1.2 Why GitHub?  Don’t really have a choice—industry standard! Cloud backup Collaboration, version control Don’t have to reinvent the wheel: use existing Git repos Community review of your code Other uses: GitHub forum, hosting websites, GitHub Classroom, etc.   1.3 Setup for RStudio Make your account and install into RStudio\n Sign up at www.github.com In console: install.packages(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;) - If this doesn’t work, you might need to update your R - Update at https://www.r-project.org/  Start your first project\n Create a new GitHub Repository (If collaborative) Open options in your repo -\u0026gt; Share with collaborators In the GitHub repo: Clone or Download -\u0026gt; Copy the repo link In RStudio: File -\u0026gt; New Project -\u0026gt; Version Control -\u0026gt; Git -\u0026gt; Paste the link Check out Git tab in top right corner alongside Environment, History, and Connections  Quick note\n Gitignore: what local files or filetypes should Git ignore in prompting you to Commit in the Git tab? (e.g., *.Rproj in your .gitignore) Readme: let people know what cool thing you’re building in your readme.md  More information: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/git-setup\n 1.4 Three Main Git Functions Commit: create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) Push: push the local version of directory into your Git directory, i.e, your repo (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) Pull: pull the current online version of the project into your local directory. Used when the online version has been edited since you last clones/pulled. Maintains both the changes in the online version and your local version  Very simple guide on the workflow: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed guide: https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html\n 1.5 Working with Git from the Shell Use man git in Shell for help\n Commit: git commit -m \u0026quot;Commit message\u0026quot; Push: git push origin master Pull: git pull   1.6 More Resources  GitHub Cheat Sheet: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf A solid introduction: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668    2 R Markdown (aka Rmd) 2.1 What is Rmd? “R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code, like the document below.” - https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html\n 2.2 Why Rmd?  This is written in Rmd! So cool! Using Rscripts is cumbersome: Rmd lets you analyze and present data in one go Can publish as html, pdf, and word doc Automatically LaTeXs if you publish to pdf Can handle complex scientific and mathematic notation   2.3 Setup Very simple. Next time you make a new file, make it a R Markdown file instead of a R script and save it as x.Rmd\n 2.4 Chunks and Chunk Options Chunks\nA mini-R-script in the middle of your text, headings, etc. in Markdown\nE.g.:\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Making a random dummy dataframe x \u0026lt;- data.frame(replicate(5,sample(0:1,1000,rep=TRUE))) # Print three rows of our dummy df x[1:3,] ## X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 ## 1 0 1 1 0 0 ## 2 0 1 0 0 0 ## 3 0 1 0 0 1 Chunk Options\nYou might not want to show your code, the warnings, and messages but show the output–Rmd let’s you control that.\nE.g.: There’s a hidden chunk below but you’ll only see the table it outputs\nhtml { font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
