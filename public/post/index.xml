      <description>I built a web app with Ilkin Bayramli studying gunshots in Washington D.C. We do interactive geospatial animated analysis of gunshot data: i.e., select your inputs to view animated maps of gunshots in DC in different time periods.

Thanks to Jillian Carr and Jennifer Doleac for building the shotspotter dataset with the Justice Tech Lab in DC. The way the shotspotter dataset is made is quite interesting: &amp;ldquo;acoustic sensors detect the sound of gunfire and record the precise timestamp as well as the triangulated location of all gunfire incidents in a covered area.</description>

      <description>Notes from a guest lecture I delivered in March 2019 at the Department of Computer Science at Stella Maris College, Chennai, offering a simple introduction to GitHub with R and R Markdown.
1 GitHub 1.1 What is GitHub?  Cloud-based version control system But what is version control?
 - Simple analogy: Google Drive for developers - Track and manage changes to your code - Version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging - Work with online Git repository - Make changes in your own branch - Merge with online cloud branch - Changes are tracked and can be reverted if needed   1.</description>
