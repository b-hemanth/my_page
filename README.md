# Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy's Personal Site

Site: [**_b-hemanth.com_**](https://b-hemanth.com)

A static website written in barebones HTML and CSS with some minimal JS after frustration and tiredom with Jekyll, Hugo, et al. Thanks to Basil Halperin who graciously permitted me to steal the beautiful LaTeX-y stylesheet from [basilhalperin.com](https://basilhalperin.com) and to [Sonia Jaffe](https://soniajaffe.com) who in turn provided the skeleton for Basil's own site. Feel free to do whatever you want with what I've done with Basil's sitemap and styles.
