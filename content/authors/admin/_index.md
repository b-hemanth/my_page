I am an undergrad, an optimist interested in issues of international development, and a *retired* [debater](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html). 

I am interested in using evidence to build better public policy (and so, in administrative data, public finance, and state capacity), poverty alleviation and some things that drive it like education, migration, and finance, and deriving insights from psychology to better understand economic problems.

I grew up in the lazy but enchanting metropolis of Chennai, India. In my free time, I like forcing friends into unsolicited expositions about politics, running, walking around and absorbing cities, and listening to the musics of the subcontinent---film, *Qawwalis*, *Hindustani*, and *Carnatic*.
