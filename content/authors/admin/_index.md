I am an undergrad, a frustrated optimist, and a *retired* [debater](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html).

I am captivated by the science and practice of development. I am interested in evidence-based policy-making, better using limited state capacity to transform lives, having the high quality, high frequency administrative data we need to plan and evaluate, and deriving insights from psychology to better understand economic problems. I am also interested in poverty alleviation and upward mobility and some things that drive them: education, migration, cities, banking, capital, and opportunity. My work follows my interests.

I grew up in the lazy but enchanting metropolis of Chennai, India. In my free time, I like forcing friends into hearing unsolicited expositions about Indian and global politics, running, walking around and absorbing cities, and the musics of the subcontinent---film, *Hindustani*, *Qawwalis*, and *Carnatic*.
