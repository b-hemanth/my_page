I'm privileged to share that I've contributed to the 2019-20 RBI Report on Trends and Progress in Banking in India. Do check out Chapter 2 (and Box II.1 therein), co-authored with Dr. Snehal Herwadkar, Director of Banking Research and the incredible editor of the report, and (the amazing) Bhanu Pratap on global savings since COVID-19: [here](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/4GLOBALBANKINGDEVELOPMENTS55F68B71F7A342F78129D0839EB4F9EE.PDF).
