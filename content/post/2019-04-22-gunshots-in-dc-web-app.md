I built a web app with [Ilkin Bayramli](https://github.com/ibayramli2001) studying gunshots in Washington D.C. We do interactive geospatial animated analysis of gunshot data: i.e., select your inputs to view animated maps of gunshots in DC in different time periods.

Thanks to Jillian Carr and Jennifer Doleac for building the [shotspotter](http://justicetechlab.org/shotspotter-data/) dataset with the Justice Tech Lab in DC. The way the shotspotter dataset is made is quite interesting: "acoustic sensors detect the sound of gunfire and record the precise timestamp as well as the triangulated location of all gunfire incidents in a covered area."
