summary: Control over the media has been a consistent ingredient of the autocratic modus operandi. However, as dissent and opposition move online on to social media, how do strongmen leaders still control and set narratives? I describe the prevalent use of Twitter Bots in India by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. First, I offer evidence of bots reacting to key events with disaggregation of events and study of time lags showing that bot creation is highest when there is a dominating political event occurring and progressively falls with time or with lower national relevance of the event. Here I find a regression coefficient of 80.742***, between the bot creation in a day and key political events—evidence that more than twice the median number of bots created in a day are created on days with key events. Second, I present evidence around their strategy, networks/clustering, and amplification---dual prongs of mass retweeting and mentioning “seed” bots and prominent pro-BJP sources. Finally, I offer quasi-evidence of propagandic sentiments in use by Tweets and account descriptions and coordination between bots.
