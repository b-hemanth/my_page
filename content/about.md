I am a *student*, *prospective economist*, *retiring* [*debater*](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html), and *impatient optimist*. Currently, I am the Research Assistant to the Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the Government of India and a Trainee Analyst at the Reserve Bank of India. 

I am interested in issues of development, public finance, behavioral science, and India. My work so far has focused on economic research, evidence-based public policy (consulting, implementation, and evaluation), building reliable administrative data, and monetary policy.

## Work 

I am a rising junior at Harvard where I study Applied Mathematics and Economics with a secondary in Computer Science. At Harvard, I am the (founding) Director of Publicity for the Harvard Undergraduate Inclusion in Economics association, a chairperson of the debate union, and an active participant in events and discourse concerning South Asia. 

Experience: 

- 2020-21: I am on a gap year (sabbatical) from Harvard. I am working on the [Economic Survey of India](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/) and the fiscal budget writ large as the Research Assistant to the Chief Economic Advisor (CEA), Government of India. I am also a Trainee at the Reserve Bank of India where I'll spend 15 days tailing the Directors, 1 month placed in a division of my choice, and several months co-authoring research with top bank economists.
- Summer 2020: I worked on (for Heather Schofield) [1] research tracking the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on Indian migrants, [2] randomized trials on migrant loneliness, networks, and productivity and on regularizing labor supply amongst casual construction workers, and (for J-PAL) [3] on writing communication, administrative data, and dashboard related policy briefs for Indian ministries.
- 2019-20: while at Harvard, I was a part-time researcher on a team of Harvard economists and psychologists conducting a large study of implicit bias and its effects on student outcomes across US community colleges.
- Summer 2019: I liaised between experts, bureaucrats, and politicians at J-PAL South Asia to evaluate and build policy, served as a consultant to the Tamil Nadu Welfare Ministry and worked with their top brass, and built and evaluated the state 24-hour Women's Helpline.

## Personal

I am from and of the lazy but enchanting metropolis of Chennai, India. Chennai, formerly and fondly *Madras*, is known as *வந்தாரை வாழவைக்கும் சென்னை* or *the city that gives life to its seekers*. As a child of rural-urban migrants, I grew up a part of the Madras hustle, its enterprise, and pursuit of better futures; that in part explains my fascination with cities, migration, and culture. When not working, you can find me dazedly listening to the musics of the subcontinent---*Qawwalis*, *Hindustani*, film, and some *Carnatic*---or offering unsolicited expositions on Indian and global politics.
