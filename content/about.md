Hello!

I am **Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy,** an undergraduate student at Harvard interested in development and behavioral economics. I concentrate in Applied Math & Economics with a secondary in Computer Science. I spend my free time telling stories with data, reading about education policy, and arguing feminist theory. I talk a lot about politics and my beautiful hometown of Chennai, India. 

I work as a research assistant at the Harvard Kennedy School for Professors Michela Carlana, David Deming, and Mahzarin Banaji, and Dr. L. Shi on their work on "Addressing Implicit Bias of Faculty," studying the impact of faculty implicit bias training through a RCT in American community colleges. (Status: fieldwork in preparation.) I spent the summer of 2019 working as a Research Intern at J-PAL South Asia's biggest office in Chennai.

I am also a parliamentary debater (I debated for [Team India](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-win-the-argument-school-students-win-silver-medal-in-world-debating-championship-in-croatia/story-0OYWOjQAWrHD9UlCk3DDON.html) in school, and now do so for the [Harvard College Debating Union](https://www.hcdu.org/)). Furthermore, I spent a lot of time in school working around issues involving equity, sexual harassment, and diversity and inclusion, and I care deeply about these issues. 

My GitHub, LinkedIn, and Curriculum Vitae are linked above.
