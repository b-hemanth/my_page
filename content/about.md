Hello!

<img alt = '(A picture of me, I am wearing a blue shirt and seated in front of a tree)' width='200' src='/post/hemanth.jpg'/>

I am Hemanth/ஹேமந்த், a rising junior at Harvard interested in the science and practice of public policy. I concentrate in Applied Math and Economics with a secondary in Computer Science. I care about economic growth, development, human behavior, and the relationship between them. I am currently working on improving companies to mutually benefit business and workers in the developing world and public policy vis a vis COVID-19 and tracking the impact of COVID on daily wagers and migrant workers in India. I talk a lot about politics and my beautiful hometown of Chennai, India.

I am always interested in talking with those with similar interests. Connect with me:
