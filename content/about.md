I am a *student*, *prospective economist*, *retiring* [*debater*](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html), and *impatient optimist*. 

I'm interested in the science and practice of development. I care about informing policy and decision-making with data and evidence, deriving insights from psychology to understand economic problems, and disruptive innovation and enterprise that improves the lives of the poor.

## Work 

I am a rising junior at Harvard where I study Applied Mathematics and Economics with a secondary in Computer Science. At Harvard, I am the (founding) Director of Publicity for the Harvard Undergraduate Inclusion in Economics association, a chairperson of the debate union, and an active participant in events and discourse concerning South Asia. 

I am currently working on (1) research tracking the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on Indian migrants, (2) randomized trials on migrant loneliness, networks, and productivity and on regularizing labor supply amongst casual construction workers, and (3) on writing communication-related policy briefs for Indian ministries. I have experience liaising between experts, bureaucrats, and politicians at J-PAL South Asia to evaluate and build policy, working on research in education policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, and in aiding building India's international debate presence.

Access my resumé [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j9y4md59lo4m5rv/BharathaChakravarthy_Hemanth_resume_jun20.pdf?dl=0). I have compiled some serious work as well as several pet data projects on my [blog](https://www.b-hemanth.com/).

## Personal

I am from and of the lazy but enchanting metropolis of Chennai, India. Chennai, formerly and fondly *Madras*, is known as *வந்தாரை வாழவைக்கும் சென்னை* or *the city that breathes life into all that seek it*. As a child of rural-urban migrants, I grew up a part of the Madras hustle, its enterprise, and pursuit of better futures, and that in part explains my fascination with cities, migration, and culture. 

When not working, you can find me dazedly listening to *Qawwalis* or offering unsolicited expositions on Indian and global politics.
