## Bio

<img alt = '(A picture of me, I am wearing a blue shirt and seated in front of a tree)' width='200' src='/post/hemanth.jpg'/>

I am a _student, a retired [debater](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html), and an impatient optimist_. 

I'm interested in the science and practice of development; I care about informing policy and decision-making with evidence, deriving insights from psychology to understand economic problems, and disruptive innovation and enterprise that improves the lives of the poor. I am a rising junior at Harvard where I study Applied Math and Economics with a secondary in Computer Science. 

I talk a lot about politics and my beautiful hometown of Chennai, India.

## Work

I am currently working on research tracking the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on Indian migrants, randomized trials on migrant loneliness, networks, and productivity and on regularizing labor supply amongst casual construction workers, and on writing policy briefs for J-PAL. I have experience liaising between experts, bureaucrats, and politicians in India to evaluate and build policy, working on research in education policy, and in aiding building India's international debate presence.
