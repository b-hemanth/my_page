Hello!

I am **Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy (ஹேமந்த் பரத சக்கரவர்த்தி),** an undergraduate student at Harvard interested in development and behavioral economics and India, weaving a career in research and public policy. I concentrate in Applied Math & Economics with a secondary in Computer Science/Government. I spend my free time telling stories with data, reading about education policy, and arguing feminist theory. I talk a lot about politics and my beautiful hometown of Chennai, India. 

My GitHub, LinkedIn, and Curriculum Vitae are linked above.
