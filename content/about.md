Hello! I am Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy, a first-year undergraduate student at Harvard University. I aspire to a career in research and academia. I plan to pursue a Concentration in Applied Mathematics and Economics with a Secondary in Computer Science. I am deeply interested in economics, data science, public policy, computer science, and feminist theory. I am also a parliamentary debater (I debated for [Team India](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-win-the-argument-school-students-win-silver-medal-in-world-debating-championship-in-croatia/story-0OYWOjQAWrHD9UlCk3DDON.html) in school, and now do so for the [Harvard College Debating Union](https://www.hcdu.org/)). Furthermore, I spent a lot of time in school working around issues involving equity, sexual harassment, and diversity and inclusion, and I care deeply about these issues.
