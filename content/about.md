Hello!

<img alt = '(A picture of me, I am wearing a blue shirt and seated in front of a tree)' width='200' src='/post/hemanth.jpg'/>

I am Hemanth Bharatha Chakravarthy (ஹேமந்த்), a rising junior at Harvard interested in the science and practice of public policy. I concentrate in Applied Math and Economics with a secondary in Computer Science. I have a background in economic research, public policy, and [debate](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html). I care about economic growth, development, human behavior, and the relationship between them. I am currently working on improving companies to mutually benefit business and workers in the developing world and public policy vis a vis COVID-19 and tracking the impact of COVID on daily wagers and migrant workers in India.  I talk a lot about politics and my beautiful hometown of Chennai, India.

I have compiled some serious work as well as several pet data projects on my [blog](https://www.b-hemanth.com/). For **writing samples**, consider this [draft](https://www.b-hemanth.com/2020/05/17/twitter-botocracy-evidence-from-the-use-of-twitter-bots-by-modi-s-bjp-in-india/) on bot use by the BJP in Indian political twitter and this [draft](https://www.b-hemanth.com/2020/05/17/twitter-botocracy-evidence-from-the-use-of-twitter-bots-by-modi-s-bjp-in-india/) of a comprehensive review of literature, policy evaluation, and policy brief on performance-based pay for public school teachers. 

I am always interested in talking with those who share interests. Connect with me:
