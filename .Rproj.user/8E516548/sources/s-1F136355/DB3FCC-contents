I am an undergraduate student (on leave) in Applied Maths and Economics at Harvard. I am also a consultant in public policy and finance at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in India. I care about economic development and social protection and some things that drive them like service delivery, state capacity, and political economy. 

I grew up in the lazy but enchanting metropolis of Chennai. In my free time, I like forcing friends into unsolicited expositions about politics, running, visiting old street markets and tea shops, and appreciating Tamil cinema and literature. In another life, I was a [debater](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html) and coach.
