I am an undergrad (on leave) and an optimist concerned about international development. 

I am interested in fixing the (Indian) state and so in public finance and administration. I care about upward mobility---and some things that drive it like education, public health, and social inequality---and about deriving insights from politics and psychology to better diagnose economic problems.

I grew up in the lazy but enchanting metropolis of Chennai, India. In my free time, I like forcing friends into unsolicited expositions about politics, running, loitering around old cities and tea shops, appreciating Tamil cinema and literature, and listening to the musics of the subcontinent. In another life, I was a [debater](https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html) and coach.
