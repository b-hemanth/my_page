<p>
	Hey, I'm Hemanth. ðŸ‘‹  At the moment, I am dreaming about reimagining/democratizing legal processes and information using AI. I.e., I'm building India's first AI paralegal, co-founded with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benhoffner/">Ben Hoffner-Brodsky</a> in Chennai. Laws and legal agents exist to protect principals' rights and gainful relationships, but centuries of fraud have made procedure an end of its own. Much of legal work is needle-in-a-haystack retrieval (precedent/statutory research, diligence, etc.) or repeated and predictable negotiation (ODR, contract deal flow, etc.). I'm thinking about how we can denoise these processes using technology in favor of principals, while increasing the job satisfaction of lawyers. Intelligibility can make access more meaningful.
</p>
<p>
	Otherwise, I'm a mutinous sepoy in the neural industrial revolution, concerned about universalizing both the access to and the value generated by AI and safely distributing this moment in technology to millions of global persons. I graduated early (or late, after a gap year) with an A.B. in Economics from Harvard in December 2022.
</p>
<p>
	Before switching to startups and AI, I worked in research and government. For 1.5 years, I was a Consultant under Dr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/santhoshmathewresearchpolicy/" target="_blank">Santhosh Mathew</a> (ex-IAS) at the Delhi office of the Gates Foundation where I led verticals on algorithmic public finance, smart contracts, procurement marketplaces, and digital health. I've coauthored some institutional publications including high-dimensional macro-financial <a href="https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/annualpublications.aspx?head=trend%20and%20progress%20of%20banking%20in%20india" target="_blank">models</a> at the Reserve Bank of India and a chapter in the <a href="https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/" target="_blank">Economic Survery of India</a> in the 2021 Union Budget. I was the Research Assistant to the Chief Economic Advisor to the Government of India and have spent time in a variety of development labs including <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/innovations-data-and-experiments-action-initiative" target="_blank">J-PAL</a>, the <a href="https://www.goodbusinesslab.org/" target="_blank">Good Business Lab</a>, and the Harvard Kennedy School. Broadly, I'm still passionate about public health, social protection, state capacity, and economic development.
</p>

<p>
	I spend my better days writing short stories and translating fiction and won the 2022 Charles Edmund Horman Prize for fiction-writing at Harvard. Outside of my work, I care a lot about anti-caste ideas, local politics, and queer theory. I also map tea shops, rank parotta masters, stalk antique street markets, and philosophize about Tamil cinema. In another life, I was a debater and coach&mdash;in high school, I was a <a href="https://www.edexlive.com/news/2018/aug/02/meet-indias-youngest-debate-guns-who-matched-wits-with-the-best-in-the-world-3562.html" target="_blank">Grand Finalist</a> at the world championships and Best Speaker at both the biggest Indian university parliamentary debates.
